# Patter Recognition Learning
 
In this repository are contained the assignments and labs from the class "Patter Recognition and Introduction to Machine Learning", I attended in AGH University of Krakow, during my Erasmus+ studies there.
 
In these assignments, Orange was used, an open source machine learning and data visualization toolkit.
